# Introduction to Python

Welcome to the course! This curriculum is designed to take you from a Python beginner to building robust scripts, data analysis tools, and backend services.

## Why Python?

Python is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages today. It is known for its clean, readable syntax that resembles English, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.

What makes Python special:

- **Readability**: Focuses on clear, simple code that is easy to learn and maintain.
- **Vibrant Community**: A massive ecosystem of libraries for everything from web development to artificial intelligence.
- **Interpreted Nature**: Allows for rapid prototyping and interactive development.

Popular use cases for Python include data science, machine learning, web backend development (Django, Flask), automation scripts, and scientific computing.

## Getting Started

To follow along with the exercises, you need to have **Bun** installed on your system.

**Note**: You do **not** need to install Python locally! Our environment uses a specialized runner that executes Python code within a JavaScript runtime, ensuring a consistent experience regardless of your local Python version.

### 1. Install Bun

If you don't have Bun installed, follow the instructions at [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Verify Installation

Ensure `bun` is in your PATH. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
bun --version
```
