# Introduction to JavaScript

Welcome to the course! This curriculum is designed to take you from a JavaScript beginner to building dynamic web applications and powerful server-side tools.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world. Originally created to make web pages interactive, it has evolved into a versatile language that runs everywhere—from browsers and servers to mobile apps and IoT devices.

What makes JavaScript special:

- **Ubiquity**: It's the only language that runs natively in every web browser.
- **Asynchronous Design**: Built for non-blocking I/O, making it highly efficient for network-heavy tasks.
- **Massive Ecosystem**: Access to millions of packages through npm and bun, allowing you to build complex features quickly.

Popular use cases for JavaScript include interactive web frontends (using frameworks like React or Vue), backend services, mobile applications (React Native), and even desktop apps (Electron).

## Getting Started

To follow along with the exercises and run your code, you need to have **Bun** installed on your system. Bun is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit that we use to execute your code.

### 1. Install Bun

If you don't have Bun installed, follow the instructions at [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Verify Installation

Ensure `bun` is in your PATH. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
bun --version
```
