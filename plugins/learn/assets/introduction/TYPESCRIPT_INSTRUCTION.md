# Introduction to TypeScript

Welcome to the course! This curriculum is designed to help you master TypeScript, a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript was created to solve the challenges of building and maintaining large-scale JavaScript applications. By adding a type system, it allows developers to catch errors early and provides superior developer tools.

What makes TypeScript special:

- **Type Safety**: Catches bugs at compile time that would otherwise cause crashes at runtime.
- **Better Developer Experience**: Provides rich IDE features like autocompletion and easier refactoring.
- **Modern Features**: Includes the latest JavaScript features while maintaining compatibility with older environments via compilation.

TypeScript is the industry standard for modern web development. It is used by almost every major tech company and is the preferred choice for frameworks like Angular and many modern React projects.

## Getting Started

To follow along with the exercises and run your code, you need to have **Bun** installed on your system. Bun natively handles TypeScript files, so you won't need a separate transpilation step.

### 1. Install Bun

If you don't have Bun installed, follow the instructions at [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Verify Installation

Ensure `bun` is in your PATH. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
bun --version
```
