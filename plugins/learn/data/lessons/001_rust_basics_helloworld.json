A macro is a special kind of code that writes other code for you. The `!` at the end tells Rust it's a macro, not a regular function.\n\nEvery Rust program starts with a `main` function, which is the entry point where execution begins. The `fn` keyword declares a function, and curly braces `{}` define the function body.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic Print\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, World!\");\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Printing Multiple Lines\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"First line\");\n    println!(\"Second line\");\n}\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nWrite a Rust program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\n**Starter Files:**\n**file: main.rs**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    todo!(\"Print 'Hello, World!' here\");\n}\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- Use the `println!` macro\n- Remember the `!` at the end of `println`\n- The text goes inside quotes `\" \"`\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nHello, World!\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] The program compiles without errors\n- [ ] The output matches exactly \"Hello, World!\"\n- [ ] The code uses `println!` correctly\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting the `!`**: `println` without `!` won't work - it's a macro, not a function.\n2. **Missing quotes**: Text must be in double quotes `\" \"` to be treated as a string.\n3. **Extra spaces**: The output must match exactly, including punctuation.\n\n## Summary\nYou've written your first Rust program! Key points:\n- `fn main()` is where every Rust program starts\n- `println!` prints text to the console\n- Rust code is structured with clear syntax rules\n- The compiler helps catch mistakes early\n\nGreat job taking your first step in Rust! Next, we'll explore variables and data types.",
