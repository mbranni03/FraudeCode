This means once you assign a value to a variable, you cannot change it. This is a key feature of Rust that helps prevent bugs and makes code easier to reason about.\n\nTo make a variable mutable (changeable), you use the `mut` keyword when declaring it. This tells Rust that you intend to change the value later.\n\n**Key Terms:**\n- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed after creation (default in Rust)\n- **Mutable**: Can be changed after creation (requires `mut` keyword)\n- **Binding**: The act of assigning a value to a variable name\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nImmutability helps catch bugs at compile time and makes code more predictable. Mutable variables are useful when you need to update values, like tracking stock prices.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Immutable Variable\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let stock_price = 100; // Immutable by default\n    println!(\"Initial price: {}\", stock_price);\n\n    // stock_price = 105; // This would cause a compile error!\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Mutable Variable\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut stock_price = 100; // Mutable with `mut`\n    println!(\"Initial price: {}\", stock_price);\n\n    stock_price = 105; // This works because it's mutable\n    println!(\"Updated price: {}\", stock_price);\n}\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nCreate a program that:\n1. Declares an immutable stock price\n2. Attempts to update it (this should fail to compile)\n3. Then fixes it by making the variable mutable\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: src/main.rs**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    // Step 1: Declare an immutable stock price\n    let stock_price = 100;\n    println!(\"Initial price: {}\", stock_price);\n\n    // Step 2: Try to update it (this should fail)\n    stock_price = 105; // This will cause a compile error\n\n    // Step 3: Fix it by making it mutable\n    // Your code here\n}\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- The first attempt should fail to compile - that's expected!\n- To fix it, add `mut` to the variable declaration\n- Remember to print the updated price after changing it\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nInitial price: 100\nUpdated price: 105\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] The program compiles successfully after making the variable mutable\n- [ ] The output shows both the initial and updated stock prices\n- [ ] You understand why the first attempt failed to compile\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting `mut`**: Trying to change a variable without declaring it mutable. *Fix*: Add `mut` to the variable declaration.\n2. **Re-declaring variables**: Using `let` again for the same variable name. *Fix*: Just assign the new value without `let`.\n\n## Summary\n- Variables in Rust are immutable by default\n- Use `mut` to make variables mutable when needed\n- Immutability helps prevent bugs and makes code more predictable\n- Mutable variables are useful for values that need to change, like stock prices\n\n---\n**Next Steps:** Once you've completed this task, you'll be ready to learn about data types in Rust! The concepts you've learned here about mutability will be important as you work with different types of data.",
