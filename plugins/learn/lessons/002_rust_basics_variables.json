This design choice helps prevent bugs and makes code easier to reason about. To make a variable mutable (changeable), you must explicitly declare it with the `mut` keyword.\n\n**Key Terms:**\n- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed after declaration (default in Rust)\n- **Mutable**: Can be changed after declaration (requires `mut` keyword)\n- **Binding**: Associating a variable name with a value\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nImmutability is a core principle in Rust that enables safety guarantees. Understanding mutability helps you write more predictable and maintainable code.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Immutable Variable\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let stock_price = 100.0; // Immutable by default\n    println!(\"Initial stock price: {}\", stock_price);\n\n    // stock_price = 105.0; // This would cause a compile error!\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Mutable Variable\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut stock_price = 100.0; // Mutable with `mut`\n    println!(\"Initial stock price: {}\", stock_price);\n\n    stock_price = 105.0; // This works!\n    println!(\"Updated stock price: {}\", stock_price);\n}\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\n1. Declare an immutable variable `stock_price` with an initial value of `100.0`.\n2. Try to update it to `105.0` without using `mut` and observe the compiler error.\n3. Fix the error by making the variable mutable and update the value successfully.\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: src/main.rs**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    // Step 1: Declare an immutable stock_price variable\n    let stock_price = 100.0;\n    println!(\"Initial stock price: {}\", stock_price);\n\n    // Step 2: Try to update it without `mut` (this will fail)\n    // Uncomment the next line to see the error\n    // stock_price = 105.0;\n\n    // Step 3: Fix by making it mutable and update the value\n    // Your code here\n}\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- Use `let mut` instead of `let` to make a variable mutable\n- The compiler error will tell you that you cannot assign twice to an immutable variable\n- After fixing, print the updated value to verify\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nInitial stock price: 100\nUpdated stock price: 105\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] The program compiles without errors\n- [ ] The initial stock price is printed\n- [ ] The updated stock price is printed after modification\n- [ ] You've observed the compiler error when trying to modify an immutable variable\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting `mut` when needed**: If you try to modify a variable without `mut`, Rust will give a clear error. Always check if your variable needs to be mutable.\n2. **Overusing `mut`**: Not all variables need to be mutable. Use immutability where possible for safer code.\n3. **Shadowing vs. mutability**: Remember that `let` can be used to shadow a variable (create a new one with the same name), which is different from mutability.\n\n## Summary\n- Variables in Rust are immutable by default\n- Use `mut` to make a variable mutable\n- The compiler will help you catch mutability errors\n- Prefer immutability when possible for safer, more predictable code\n---\n\nThis lesson introduces you to one of Rust's fundamental concepts. Mastering variables and mutability will give you a solid foundation for more advanced topics!",
