  "markdown": "---\n# Hello World Program\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Write your first Python program\n- Understand the purpose of the `print()` function\n- Learn basic Python syntax rules\n\n## Concept Explanation\nEvery programming journey starts with a simple program that displays \"Hello World\". In Python, we use the `print()` function to output text to the console. This function takes what's inside the parentheses and displays it on the screen.\n\nPython is a high-level programming language that reads like English. It uses simple syntax (rules for writing code) that makes it beginner-friendly. When you write Python code, you're giving instructions to the computer to perform specific tasks.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic Hello World\n```python\n# This is a comment - the computer ignores this line\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n\n### Example 2: Printing Multiple Lines\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\nprint(\"This is my first Python program\")\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nWrite a Python program that prints two lines:\n1. Your first name\n2. Your last name\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: hello_world.py**\n```python\n# This is where you'll write your code\n# Remember to use the print() function\npass  # Remove this line and add your code\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- Each `print()` statement displays one line of text\n- Put your name inside quotation marks\n- Make sure to use parentheses after `print`\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nJohn\nDoe\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] The program runs without errors\n- [ ] Your first name appears on the first line\n- [ ] Your last name appears on the second line\n- [ ] Both names are spelled correctly\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting quotation marks**: Always put text inside quotes when using `print()`\n2. **Missing parentheses**: `print` without parentheses will cause an error\n3. **Spelling errors**: Python is case-sensitive, so `Print` won't work\n\n## Summary\nYou've written your first Python program! The `print()` function is one of the most basic but important tools in Python. It helps you communicate with the user and debug your programs. As you continue learning, you'll use `print()` to display results and track your program's progress.",
