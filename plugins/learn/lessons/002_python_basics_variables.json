They have names (identifiers) and hold values of specific types. Python has several built-in data types:\n\n1. **Integers (int)**: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3, 1000)\n2. **Floats (float)**: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 2.0)\n3. **Strings (str)**: Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., \"hello\", 'Python')\n4. **Booleans (bool)**: True/False values (e.g., True, False)\n\nVariables are created when you assign a value to them using the `=` operator. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type when creating a variable.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Creating Variables\n```python\n# Creating variables of different types\nage = 25                # integer\nheight = 5.9            # float\nname = \"Alice\"          # string\nis_student = True       # boolean\n```\n\n### Example 2: Using Variables in Expressions\n```python\n# Using variables in calculations\nlength = 10\nwidth = 5\narea = length * width   # Calculates area of a rectangle\n\n# Using variables in strings\ngreeting = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"  # Combines strings\n```\n\n### Example 3: Type Conversion\n```python\n# Converting between types\nnum_str = \"123\"\nnum_int = int(num_str)  # Converts string to integer\n\nprice = 19.99\nprice_str = str(price)  # Converts float to string\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nCreate a program that:\n1. Stores your name, age, and favorite number in variables\n2. Calculates what your age will be in 10 years\n3. Prints a message combining all this information\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: variables_practice.py**\n```python\n# TODO: Create variables for your personal information\n# TODO: Calculate your age in 10 years\n# TODO: Print a message with all the information\npass\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- Use the `+` operator to combine strings (concatenation)\n- Remember to convert numbers to strings before combining with text\n- Think about what data type each piece of information should be\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nHello, my name is Alice and I'm 25 years old.\nMy favorite number is 7.\nIn 10 years, I'll be 35 years old.\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] Variables are created with appropriate names and types\n- [ ] Age calculation is correct\n- [ ] Output message matches the expected format\n- [ ] All variables are used in the final output\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Type Errors**: Trying to combine different types without conversion (e.g., string + integer). Fix by converting types using `str()`, `int()`, or `float()`.\n2. **Variable Naming**: Using Python keywords as variable names or starting names with numbers. Fix by using descriptive names that start with letters.\n3. **Reassignment**: Forgetting that variables can be changed. Remember that variables are like containers - you can put new values in them anytime.\n\n## Summary\nVariables are fundamental building blocks in programming. They allow you to store and manipulate data efficiently. Understanding data types helps you work with different kinds of information appropriately. As you practice, you'll develop intuition about when to use each type and how to convert between them when needed.",
