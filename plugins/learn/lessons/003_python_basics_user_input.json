The `input()` function pauses execution and waits for the user to type something, while `print()` displays messages or results. This is essential for creating programs that respond to user actions.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic Input and Output\n```python\n# This program asks for your name and greets you\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n```\n\n### Example 2: Simple Calculator\n```python\n# This program adds two numbers entered by the user\nnum1 = input(\"Enter first number: \")\nnum2 = input(\"Enter second number: \")\nresult = int(num1) + int(num2)  # Converting strings to integers\nprint(\"The sum is:\", result)\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nCreate a program that asks the user for their favorite color and then prints a message incorporating that color.\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: favorite_color.py**\n```python\n# TODO: Ask the user for their favorite color\n# TODO: Print a message using their favorite color\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- Use `input()` to get the user's favorite color\n- Store the input in a variable\n- Use `print()` to display a message with the color\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nWhat is your favorite color? blue\nYour favorite color is blue!\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] Program asks for favorite color\n- [ ] Program stores the input in a variable\n- [ ] Program prints a message using the input\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting to convert input to numbers**: When doing math, remember `input()` returns a string. Use `int()` or `float()` to convert.\n2. **Missing the prompt in `input()`**: Always include a helpful message inside `input()` so the user knows what to enter.\n\n## Summary\nUser input and output are fundamental for interactive programs. The `input()` function captures user data, while `print()` displays results. Combining these with variables allows you to create dynamic, responsive applications.",
