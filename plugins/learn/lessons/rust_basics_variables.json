This means once a value is bound to a variable name, it cannot be changed. This design choice helps prevent accidental modifications and makes code more predictable.\n\n### Key Terminology:\n- **Immutable variable**: Cannot be changed after declaration (default in Rust)\n- **Mutable variable**: Can be changed after declaration (requires `mut` keyword)\n- **Shadowing**: Creating a new variable with the same name (different from mutability)\n\n### Why It Matters:\n- Prevents accidental data modification\n- Enables compiler optimizations\n- Makes concurrent programming safer\n\n### Common Pitfalls:\n- Forgetting `mut` when you need to modify a variable\n- Trying to reassign to an immutable variable\n- Confusing shadowing with mutability\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic Usage\n```rust\n// Immutable variable (default)\nlet stock_price = 100;\nprintln!(\"Initial price: {}\", stock_price);\n\n// This would cause a compile error:\n// stock_price = 110; // Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable\n\n// Mutable variable\nlet mut current_price = 100;\nprintln!(\"Current price: {}\", current_price);\ncurrent_price = 110; // This works\nprintln!(\"Updated price: {}\", current_price);\n```\n\n### Example 2: Applied Context\n```rust\n// Stock price tracker\nlet mut apple_stock = 150.25;\nprintln!(\"Apple stock opened at: ${:.2}\", apple_stock);\n\n// Price update during trading\napple_stock = 152.75;\nprintln!(\"Apple stock is now: ${:.2}\", apple_stock);\n\n// Attempting to update an immutable stock price\nlet tesla_stock = 800.50;\nprintln!(\"Tesla stock opened at: ${:.2}\", tesla_stock);\n// tesla_stock = 810.25; // This would fail to compile\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nCreate a program that tracks a stock price and demonstrates both immutable and mutable variables. The program should:\n1. Store an initial stock price in an immutable variable\n2. Attempt to update this price (this should fail to compile)\n3. Store the same initial price in a mutable variable\n4. Successfully update the mutable price\n5. Print all values to demonstrate the behavior\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: src/main.rs**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    // TODO: Declare an immutable stock price variable\n    // TODO: Try to update it (this should cause a compile error)\n    // TODO: Declare a mutable stock price variable with the same initial value\n    // TODO: Update the mutable variable\n    // TODO: Print all values to show the difference\n\n    println!(\"Stock price tracking demonstration\");\n    // Your implementation goes here\n}\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- Start by declaring a variable without `mut` for the immutable case\n- Remember that Rust prevents reassignment to immutable variables\n- Use `let mut` for the variable that needs to change\n- Think about what happens when you try to compile with the immutable reassignment\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe program should compile only when the immutable reassignment is removed or commented out. When complete, it should print the initial and updated stock prices.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] Program demonstrates immutable variable behavior\n- [ ] Program demonstrates mutable variable behavior\n- [ ] Program compiles successfully when immutable reassignment is removed\n- [ ] Program prints the expected output showing both cases\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nStock price tracking demonstration\nInitial immutable price: 100\nInitial mutable price: 100\nUpdated mutable price: 110\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting `mut` keyword**: Trying to modify a variable without declaring it as mutable will cause a compile error. Remember that mutability must be explicitly declared in Rust.\n2. **Confusing shadowing with mutability**: Creating a new variable with the same name (`let x = x + 1`) is different from mutability. Shadowing creates a new variable while mutability allows modification of the existing one.\n3. **Trying to modify immutable variables**: This is the most common mistake when first learning Rust. The compiler will clearly indicate when you're trying to modify an immutable variable.\n\n## Summary\nVariables in Rust are immutable by default, which helps prevent accidental modifications and makes code more predictable. To make a variable mutable, you must explicitly use the `mut` keyword. Understanding this fundamental concept is crucial for writing effective Rust code, especially when working with data that needs to change over time, like stock prices.",
