In Rust, this simple program introduces several fundamental concepts:\n\n1. **`main` function**: The entry point of every Rust program. Execution begins here.\n2. **`println!` macro**: A Rust macro (note the `!`) that prints text to the console with a newline at the end.\n3. **String literals**: Text enclosed in double quotes (`\"Hello, World!\"`).\n\n**Why it matters in Rust:**\n- Demonstrates Rust's syntax basics\n- Introduces Rust's macro system (the `!` indicates a macro)\n- Shows how Rust programs are structured\n\n**Common pitfalls:**\n- Forgetting the `!` in `println!` (it's a macro, not a function)\n- Missing the semicolon at the end of the statement\n- Not saving the file with a `.rs` extension\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic Usage\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, World!\");\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Applied Context\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    // A more descriptive greeting\n    println!(\"Welcome to Rust programming!\");\n    println!(\"This is your first program.\");\n}\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nCreate a Rust program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console. Then modify it to also print your name on the next line.\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: src/main.rs**\n```rust\n// TODO: Implement a main function that prints \"Hello, World!\"\n// TODO: Add a second println! that prints your name\n// Remember: Every Rust program starts executing from the main function\n\nfn main() {\n    todo!(\"Print 'Hello, World!' and your name\");\n}\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- The `println!` macro is what you need to output text\n- Each statement in Rust should end with a semicolon\n- You can have multiple `println!` statements in your `main` function\n- Remember to save your file with the `.rs` extension\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nWhen you run your program, it should print:\n```\nHello, World!\n[Your Name]\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] The program compiles without errors\n- [ ] The program runs and prints \"Hello, World!\" on the first line\n- [ ] The program prints your name on the second line\n- [ ] The program exits successfully\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nHello, World!\nAlice\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting the `!` in `println`**: This will cause a compilation error because `println` (without `!`) is not a function. Remember that macros in Rust end with `!`.\n2. **Missing semicolon**: Rust requires semicolons at the end of statements. Forgetting it will result in a compilation error.\n3. **Incorrect file extension**: Rust source files must have the `.rs` extension. Using `.txt` or other extensions won't work.\n4. **Not using double quotes**: String literals in Rust must be enclosed in double quotes (`\"`), not single quotes (`'`).\n\n## Summary\nYou've created your first Rust program! This simple exercise introduced you to:\n- The basic structure of a Rust program with the `main` function\n- Using the `println!` macro to output text\n- Compiling and running Rust code\n\nThe \"Hello, World!\" program is just the beginning. As you continue learning Rust, you'll build on these fundamentals to create more complex and powerful programs.",
