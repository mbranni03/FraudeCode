These are fundamental for interactive programs. The `input()` function always returns a string, so we'll need to convert it if we want other data types. We can combine variables and strings in `print()` using commas or string formatting.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Example 1: Simple Input and Output\n```python\n# Get user's name and greet them\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nprint(\"Hello,\", name)\n```\n\n### Example 2: Working with Numbers\n```python\n# Get two numbers from user and add them\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum is:\", num1 + num2)\n```\n\n## Verification Task\n\n**YOUR MISSION:**\nCreate a program that asks for a user's name and age, then prints a greeting message with both pieces of information.\n\n**Starter Files:**\n\n**file: main.py**\n```python\n# IMPLEMENTATION STUB\n# Get user's name and age\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\n\n# Print greeting with name and age\nprint(\"Hello,\", name)\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n- Use `input()` to get the age\n- Remember that `input()` returns a string - you might want to convert the age to an integer\n- Use commas in `print()` to separate different items\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\nWhat is your name? Alice\nWhat is your age? 25\nHello, Alice. You are 25 years old.\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- [ ] Program asks for name and age\n- [ ] Program correctly prints both pieces of information\n- [ ] Age is treated as a number (not a string)\n\n## Common Mistakes\n1. **Forgetting to convert input to numbers**: If you want to do math with input, you need to convert it from string using `int()` or `float()`.\n2. **Using + instead of commas in print**: `print(\"Hello\" + name)` will cause an error if name isn't a string. Use commas: `print(\"Hello\", name)`.\n\n## Summary\nYou've learned how to make your programs interactive by getting input from users and displaying output. Remember that `input()` always gives you strings, and you can combine different types in `print()` using commas. This is the foundation for building programs that can communicate with users!",
