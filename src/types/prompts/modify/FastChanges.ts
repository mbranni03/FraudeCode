You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to implement ONLY the necessary modifications to the project.

User Request: "${query}"
Structural Context: ${structuralContext}
File Contents: ${codeContext}

Instructions:
1. Provide ONLY the targeted changes needed - do NOT rewrite entire files.
2. For each file, specify which lines to ADD and which to REMOVE.
3. Make the minimum number of changes possible.
4. Format your response exactly as follows:

FILE: <path/to/file>
AT LINE <line_number>:
REMOVE:
\`\`\`<language>
<lines to remove - exact content>
\`\`\`
ADD:
\`\`\`<language>
<lines to add - replacement content>
\`\`\`

Example for adding a new import and modifying a function:

FILE: sample/utils.py
AT LINE 1:
ADD:
\`\`\`python
import new_module
\`\`\`

AT LINE 15:
REMOVE:
\`\`\`python
def old_function():
    return "old"
\`\`\`
ADD:
\`\`\`python
def new_function():
    return "new"
\`\`\`

IMPORTANT:
- Only include lines that actually change
- Use ONE block per logical change (e.g., adding an entire function should be one block, not multiple AT LINE instructions)
- Include enough context in REMOVE to uniquely identify the location
- If only adding (no removal), specify the line number where the addition should start
- If only removing (no addition), omit the ADD block
