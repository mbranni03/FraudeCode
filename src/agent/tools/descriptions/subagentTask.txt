Use this tool to coordinate a single Ralph iteration.

WHEN TO USE:
- To execute one complete iteration of the Ralph workflow
- When working through an implementation plan task by task

BEHAVIOR:
This tool orchestrates a single "fresh context" iteration:
1. Loads current progress from .fraude/progress.json
2. Picks the next pending task
3. Returns task details for execution
4. After execution, validates and updates state

RALPH PHILOSOPHY:
Each iteration runs with minimal context - only the current task and essential project info.
This avoids LLM context window issues that arise from long-running sessions.
Progress is persisted externally, allowing recovery and resume.

This is the main entry point for the Ralph prompting workflow.
