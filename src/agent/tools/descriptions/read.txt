Read a file from the local file system.
If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, this tool will read up to 500 lines of the file.
- You can optionally specify the offset and limit parameters to read a specific range of lines.
- The offset parameter is the line number to start reading from (inclusive). Line 0 is the first line.
- The limit parameter is the number of lines to read (inclusive).
