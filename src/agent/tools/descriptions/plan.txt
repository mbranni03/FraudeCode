Use this tool to generate or update an implementation plan for a complex task.

WHEN TO USE:
- When starting work on a multi-step feature or requirement
- When the user provides a project goal or PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- When breaking down complex work into actionable tasks

INPUTS:
- goal: The high-level objective or requirement description
- context: Optional additional context about the project

OUTPUT:
Generates/updates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md in .fraude/ with:
- Numbered, prioritized tasks
- Each task has clear acceptance criteria
- Tasks are atomic and independently testable

WORKFLOW:
1. Analyze the goal and any existing code context
2. Break down into small, testable user stories
3. Prioritize tasks (dependencies first)
4. Write plan to .fraude/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
5. Store structured tasks in .fraude/requirements.json

This tool is part of the Ralph prompting workflow for iterative agent execution.
