Manage persistent tasks for tracking work across iterations.

Operations:
- "add": Create a new task with description and optional notes
- "update": Update an existing task's status or notes (for worker summaries/reviewer feedback)
- "complete": Mark a task as done
- "list": Get all current tasks
- "clear": Remove all completed tasks
- "next-iteration": Increment the iteration counter for Ralph Loop

Tasks persist in .fraude/todos.json and survive context resets between Ralph Loop iterations.
Use this to:
1. Break down work into trackable items
2. Store worker iteration summaries
3. Record reviewer feedback
4. Track progress across fresh context windows
