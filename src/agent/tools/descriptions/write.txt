Writes a file to the local filesystem. Use to create new files or overwrite entire files.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.
