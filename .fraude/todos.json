        "instructions": "The `quadratic_formula` method should take coefficients a, b, and c as input. It should calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) and return the real roots using the formula x = (-b ± sqrt(discriminant)) / 2a. Handle cases where the discriminant is negative (no real roots) or zero (one real root). Import the `math` module for `sqrt` functionality."

      "notes": [
        "Added quadratic_formula helper method to combined.py. The function calculates roots of quadratic equations, handles cases with no real roots (returns None), one real root (returns tuple with single root), and two real roots (returns tuple with both roots). Imported math module for sqrt functionality."
