### Supported Providers

_I went with anyone that had a free tier_ :| (This is built on vercel AI SDK so its easy to add more providers)

- Ollama
- Mistral
- Groq
- OpenRouter
- Cerebras
- Google

### Installation

Still in dev so just clone the repo and run `bun run dev`

### Plugins

You can use plugins to extend the functionality of FraudeCode. Check out the [plugins](./plugins) directory for more information.

I'll be building out some plugins with corresponding UIs for some more fun use cases.
