# FraudeCode

FraudeCode is a learning project designed to imitate the core functionality of **Claude Code**. It provides a terminal-based interface (TUI) for analyzing, querying, and modifying codebases using local AI models.

## 🚀 Overview

The project leverages a combination of semantic search and structural analysis to assist in developer workflows:

- **Structural Analysis**: Uses **Neo4j** and **Tree-sitter** to map out function calls, class definitions, and file relationships.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses **Qdrant** and **Ollama** embeddings to locate relevant code blocks based on natural language queries.
- **Code Modification**: Implements a **LangGraph** workflow to plan and apply changes to files safely.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need the following services running locally via Docker:

- **Neo4j**: Graph database for structural relationships.
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic search.
- **Ollama**: LLM engine for embeddings and code generation.

You can start these using the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Installation

1. Install dependencies using [Bun](https://bun.sh/):
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
2. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings as needed.

### Running

1. **Index your codebase**:
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/analysis.ts
   ```
2. **Launch the CLI**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
