## What is FraudeCode?

FraudeCode is a simple AI coding agent that can help you with your coding tasks. It has 3 different modes:

- Fast Mode: Fast mode is the default mode. It will conduct research, generate code, and then test it itself.
- Planning Mode: Planning mode will create an implementation plan and tasks, using a research subagent to gather context. It will then use a worker subagent to generate code, and a reviewer subagent to review the code. This mode is recommended for larger tasks.
- Ask Mode: Ask mode will use an agent to answer a question about a codebase without altering it.
