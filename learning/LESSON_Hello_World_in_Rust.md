# Hello World in Rust

## Topics Covered
- Rust toolchain basics
- The `fn main()` entry point
- Using `println!` macro to output text
- Compiling and running a Rust program

## Lesson Content
Rust programs start execution from the `main` function.
The `println!` macro prints text to the console followed by a newline.
To run a Rust program you use `cargo run` (if using Cargo) or `rustc` to compile.

## Task
Create a Rust program that prints the text **Hello, world!** to the console.

1. Open the provided `main.rs` file.
2. Inside the `main` function, add a line that uses `println!` to output the required text.
3. Compile and run the program to see the output.

## What to Submit
When you have completed the task, run the program. The output should be:

```
Hello, world!
```

Happy coding!
